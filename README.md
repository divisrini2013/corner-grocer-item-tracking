Project Summary

The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program is a C++ program that looks at receipts for food store purchases. This tool helps the Corner Grocer figure out how people usually buy things, which helps them set up their store better and give customers a better experience. The app keeps track of how often things are bought, which helps with making choices about supplies and where to put products.

Reflection

What I Did Particularly Well

With the ItemTracker class, which groups and handles item counts well, I did a great job of making a clear and useful class structure. Adding a text-based menu that is easy to use improved the user experience by making it simple for people to move between the program's features.

Areas for Enhancement

Even though the core feature works well, I can see ways to make it better. For example, I think the problem handling when reading files or getting item counts could be better. The app would be more secure and reliable if it had better data checking and handling of errors. Also, making the frequency search method work better could help when working with bigger datasets.

Challenging Code Sections

Managing file I/O operations, especially making sure data safety during read and write operations, was the hardest part of the project. I solved this problem by looking at a lot of web sites and tools, such as Stack Overflow and the C++ literature. This experience has helped me get more help with future projects because I now have solid tools to use when I run into problems.

Transferable Skills

I got better at object-oriented programming, data management, and file handling through this project. These are all skills I will need for future projects and schoolwork. Being able to make tools that work and are easy to use will also help in joint settings.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I worked on writing well-structured and detailed code to make the program easy to manage and change. This meant giving variables names that make sense, leaving clear notes, and using uniform writing rules. These habits not only help me understand the code better in the future, but they also help anyone else who works on the project.
